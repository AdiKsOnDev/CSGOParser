# :blue_book: How to use it?
1. Run the main file in the command line using "python main.py"
2. Write the number of pages you want to parse data from
3. Write the page you want to start form

When script is done, you will have several JSON files, one HTML file and dozens of HTML files inside the "data" folder
But the only file you are interested in is called "information.json"
